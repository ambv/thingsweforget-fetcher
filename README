This is a simple script that synchronizes you all post-its from http://thingsweforget.blogspot.com
A couple of reasons why you would want to keep a separate copy of all these pictures:
 * they are highly motivational
 * you don't always have Internet access
 * you can shuffle these and for instance e-mail yourself daily one of those

How this project should be used is not yet well documented, you can request documentation from me
